        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nathan — a self-taught computer science student with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, systems programming, and startup innovation. I love building things from scratch, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies. My current focus is on LLMs, machine learning, full-stack web development, and low-level systems like compilers and operating systems.</p>
        <p>I’ve completed multiple personal projects including AI models, a full compiler, and a website for a local business. I believe in pushing the limits of what’s possible and aim to become one of the top innovators in tech.</p>
